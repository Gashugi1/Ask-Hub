 * The browse menu's model: one entry per need that has something live in it,

 * Transcribed from the approved prototype
 * (the approved prototype): (`deptMenu`). The sub-items are not a taxonomy and there is
 * no table behind them: they are the distinct `sub_category` values found on
 * the live resources filed under that need, discovered from the same rows the
 * directory renders. So a curator who types a new sub-category into the
 * resource form gets a new sub-item, and one that no live resource carries
 * any more disappears -- with no second list to keep in step.
 *
 * Deriving them here rather than in the component is what makes the rule
 * testable: the component then has no logic left to get wrong, and the four
 * decisions this file encodes (which resources count, what "distinct" means,
 * what order, how many) are each asserted in tests/unit/need-menu.test.ts.

 * reachable through the entry's own "More" link, which drops the
 * sub-category and shows every resource in the need.

 * Postgres, and are not recomputed from `resources` here. Two sources for one
 * number is how a rail and the list beneath it start disagreeing.
 *
 * The sub-category tallies have no such view behind them and are counted from
 * `resources` -- the only place a `sub_category` breakdown exists. They are
 * still true counts of real rows, not estimates: `resources` is the same live
 * set the directory filters, so a sub-item reading "3" is a promise that
 * following it shows three cards, and the same predicate decides both.
 *
 * A need with no live resource is dropped rather than rendered as a zero. An
 * entry reading "0 live" is an invitation to a dead end, and the filter
 * behind it would land the visitor on an empty directory.
 *
 * Entry order is `counts`' order, which `listNeedCounts` has already fixed to

 * menu would then rearrange itself whenever a resource is published, moving a
 * category out from under a returning visitor's cursor. A stated order stays
 * put.
 *
 * **Every need appears, `partners` included.** It was held out of this menu
 * for a while, on the reasoning that a category nobody had published into was
 * not worth a row; the menu is now the product's statement of what the
 * directory covers, so leaving one category out made the coverage look
 * narrower than it is. Its position mirrors `NEED_KEYS`, between `accelerator`

 * nameless sub-item -- a menu entry whose label is the empty string is a
 * click target a visitor cannot see, read or describe.
 *
 * Distinctness is on the trimmed value, exactly as it will be displayed, and
 * is case-sensitive: "Cloud credits" and "cloud credits" stay two entries
 * because they are two different labels on screen, and collapsing them would
 * mean choosing which of a curator's two spellings to show. The order is
 * first appearance in `resources`, which is the order the readers return.
 *
 * **The cap is applied after counting, not during it.** Every matching row is
 * tallied first and only then are the first MAX_SUB_CATEGORIES labels kept,
 * so a label's count is the whole truth about that label rather than however
 * many of its rows happened to appear before the cap was reached. Counting as
 * it went would have made the numbers depend on row order -- the one thing a
 * count must not do.
 *
 * The prototype shows no number beside a sub-item; these
 * are added at the client's instruction. Nothing about them is estimated or
 * carried over from a fixture: each is a tally of rows the page already
 * holds, so a sub-item with nothing behind it cannot exist to be
