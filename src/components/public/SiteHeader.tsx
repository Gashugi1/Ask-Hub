/**
 * Transcribed from the approved prototype
 * (the approved prototype): a sticky white rail with a 1px hairline, 1180px wide, 68px
 * tall, carrying the roundel and wordmark on the left, the search pill in the
 * middle, and the navigation on the right.
 *
 * **The one thing not transcribed: the ADMIN button.** The prototype ends the
 * rail with an outlined ADMIN button linking to the portal. PRD 5.8 forbids
 * it in as many words -- "No login link or admin reference anywhere in public
 * navigation" -- and putting an admin entry point in front of every anonymous
 * visitor is not a styling decision. Raised with the client, who ruled that
 * PRD 5.8 governs (spec D11). The portal is reachable at /admin/login and is
 * advertised nowhere, which is the whole point; nothing stands in the slot.
 *
 * **Contact is a plain nav item, not an outlined pill.** It had been wearing
 * the ADMIN button's treatment on the reasoning that the slot should keep its
 * shape. That was a guess dressed as a transcription: the prototype styles
 * Contact at line 21, in the nav row beside Home, Browse and About, with the
 * same 14px/600 navy on a 6px radius and the same #F1F4FA hover -- identical
 * to its siblings. An outlined uppercase pill gave a Contact link the visual
 * weight of a sign-in, which is exactly the emphasis PRD 5.8 wants absent.
 *
 * **Browse is gone from the nav.** The prototype's Browse item switches to a
 * directory screen. Here the directory is a band on the home page (PRD 5.1
 * item 8), so the item was an in-page jump to #directory sitting one slot
 * away from Home, which scrolls to the top of the same page -- two nav items
 * for one document. The directory is reached from the browse menu, the search
 * pill, the welcome CTA and the footer, all of which target it directly.
 * `nav.directory` stays in en.json because the footer still labels a link
 * with it.
 *
 * **On the wordmark.** `site.wordmark` is "AskHub", the product's own name,
 * as against the programme -- the AI Hub for Sustainable Development -- which
 * CLAUDE.md requires be named in full wherever it appears. The prototype
 * hides this word below 640px so the roundel and pill still fit on one row;
 * `.askhub-wordmark` in globals.css is that rule, transcribed with it.
 *
 * The mark is a local asset, so this uses next/image (which fingerprints and
 * sizes it) rather than the bare <img> PartnerRow needs for arbitrary remote
 * logo hosts. `alt=""` is deliberate: the wordmark text sits immediately
 * beside it in the same link, so announcing the image too would make screen
 * readers read the brand name twice for one control.
 *
 * Hover states arrive in the prototype as `style-hover` attributes, which are
 * not real HTML. This is a server component and converting it to a client one
 * for a background colour would be a poor trade, so the nav item's hover is
 * the global class `.proto-nav-item`.
