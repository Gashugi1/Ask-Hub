 * are the same length) and the client directory (filtered, so they can
 * differ) -- one place for the grid markup and the empty-state copy so the
 * two renderers cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Deliberately has no `'use client'` directive and no hooks: it is plain
 * presentation over props, so it is equally valid to render from a Server
 * Component and from a Client Component.
 *
 * The grid is `auto-fill` over a 290px minimum rather than the prototype's
 * fixed three columns. At the directory's 1180px measure that resolves to the
 * same three, and it is what lets the grid reflow to two and then one instead
 * of forcing a horizontal scrollbar on a narrow screen -- which the fixed
 * version does, and which PRD 5.8 ("fully mobile-responsive at every
 * breakpoint") rules out.
 *
 * The empty states take the prototype's dashed panel (reference lines
 * 281-287) but not its "Clear all filters" button: the removable chips and
 * the Clear filters control already sit directly above this, so a third route
 * to the same action would be noise.
