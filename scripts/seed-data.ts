/**
 * ============================================================================
 * PLACEHOLDER CONTENT — NOT THE CLIENT'S DATASET.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Everything below is transcribed from the prototype's `seed()` method (the
 * demo app the client reviewed before this rebuild started). The client's
 * real dataset has not arrived. This module exists so the site has
 * something real-shaped to render in the meantime, and it is expected to be
 * REPLACED WHOLESALE the moment real partner names, resources, programmes
 * and copy are supplied. Do not treat any name, URL, description or figure
 * here as confirmed, current, or delivered.
 *
 * Three categories of prototype content are deliberately absent, not
 * forgotten:
 *   - `impact_stories`, `headline_stats` and `compute_metrics` get no rows
 *     (the prototype's numbers are unsourced demo figures, and CLAUDE.md
 *     forbids seeding a plausible-looking metric onto a UN programme's
 *     reporting surface).
 *   - `programmes` gets no rows either, on later human review: every one of
 *     the prototype's six programme descriptions carries an unattested AI
 *     Hub performance figure of its own — "120 companies... 376
 *     applications", "10 ventures... 135 applications", "Mobilising up to
 *     $10B by 2035, targeting up to 45M jobs" — and `programmes_public` is
 *     anon-readable, so seeding them would put the same class of unattested
 *     claim CLAUDE.md forbids in front of a public visitor, just in prose
 *     rather than in a number column. This is a different case from the
 *     `resources` descriptions kept below: "Up to $150K in Azure credits" is
 *     Microsoft's own offer terms (directory content about someone else's
 *     programme, inherent to what a directory is), not the AI Hub reporting
 *     its own performance. `programmes` stays empty until the client
 *     supplies attested copy, consistent with the three tables above.
 *   - The four tables that would carry a real person's email address, a
 *     public proposal, a digest send history, or per-visit analytics get no
 *     rows either (the prototype's version of each is fabricated personal
 *     data / reporting history that must never enter a real system, even as
 *     a placeholder — deliberately not named here; see the note on
 *     scripts/seed.ts for why).
 * See task-12a-brief.md for the full table of what is and is not seeded
 * (programmes at 0 rows is a later human decision, made after that brief was
 * written — see task-12a-report.md's fix report for the full reasoning).
 *
 * No `@/*` imports here or anywhere under scripts/: vitest aliases `@` to
 * `./src`, but `tsx` (which runs `npm run seed`) does not, so a module that
 * typechecks and passes tests would still crash at runtime. Every union
 * below is declared locally instead of imported from generated types.
 *
 * This file is data only: no logic, no Supabase client, no database access.
 * scripts/seed.ts is the runner that upserts these arrays.

// `logo_url` and `website_url` are null for every row except the three in
// `PARTNER_ASSETS` below. The prototype carries no partner URLs at all (its
// favicon-domain trick even misattributes Stanford to coursera.org — see
// 0013_reconcile_partners.sql), so every logo here comes from the client's
// asset pack instead. supabase/migrations/0014_partner_logos.sql keeps both
// columns nullable precisely so the rest can wait: a partner row can exist
// before its asset pair (logo + site) arrives, and
// `partners_logo_requires_site` only refuses a logo with no link, which a
// name-only row never triggers.
//
// "Cyber 4.0 and Cisco" is kept as one combined name, matching the prototype
// exactly, even though it names two organisations. An earlier ruling called
// for splitting it into two partner rows so each could carry its own logo
// and link. That split is deferred to the real dataset: splitting a
// placeholder name now produces two logo-less rows that will not match
// whatever the client's real data calls these two organisations anyway, and
// the one resource that names this partner (`cyber4africa`) is seeded as
// `pipeline` regardless (see the resources section below) — the ambiguity
// is not currently public-facing.
//
// "Deep Learning Indaba" is included even though no seeded resource names it
// as a partner: it appears only on a prototype *submitted proposal* for a
// new resource (out of scope for this seed — see file header), but the task
// brief lists it among the 19 verbatim partner names, so it is seeded as a
// name-only row like the rest.
//
// "CINECA" replaces the prototype's "CINECA / AI Hub" on the client's
// confirmation that the entity is CINECA — the prototype had folded the
// facility and the programme into one free-text provider string.
// supabase/migrations/0019_ai_hub_partners.sql carries the same rename as an
// UPDATE, for a database that already holds rows when it is applied; this
// array is what performs the rename on a `db:reset` + `npm run seed`, where
// migrations run against an empty table. Both must stay in step: leaving the
// old name here would re-insert it as a 20th partner row on the next seed,
// and (because the resources upsert key is `partner,name`) would re-insert
// "CINECA Leonardo" under it as a 21st resource.

/**
 * The partners whose logo and official site the client's asset pack covers.
 *
 * The files are `public/partners/*.png`, committed in 744108a ("the client's
 * asset pack, PNG (the schema rejects SVG)"). That commit also uploaded them
 * to a Supabase Storage bucket by hand and wired three partners to the
 * resulting https URLs, because `partners_logo_https` accepted nothing else.
 * That upload is still live on the hosted project behind Vercel and still
 * renders in production -- what was never committed is anything that
 * *reproduces* it: no bucket migration, no upload script, no seeded URL. So
 * every other environment starts with 19 null logos, and a local stack cannot
 * be brought up to match, since its Supabase URL is http and the constraint
 * refused it.
 *
 * supabase/migrations/0021_partner_logo_asset_paths.sql widens that
 * constraint to also accept a site-root-relative path, which is what these
 * are: Next serves them from `public/`, on the page's own origin, with no
 * bucket involved, and they survive a `db:reset` because they are declared
 * here rather than uploaded.
 *
 * **These do not disturb the hosted rows.** The seed writes them only where
 * `logo_url` is null (see scripts/seed.ts), so running it against the
 * deployed project leaves its Storage URLs exactly as they are. The two
 * sources coexist on purpose: the deployment keeps what it has, and a
 * checkout stops depending on a bucket this repository cannot recreate.
 *
 * **Three partners, not five.** The pack also contains `cisco.png` and
 * `domyn.png`, and both stay unwired for the reason 744108a gave and this
 * seed's own header repeats. There is no Domyn partner row at all, and Cisco
 * exists only inside the combined name "Cyber 4.0 and Cisco" -- putting the
 * Cisco mark on a row that names two organisations would state something
 * about a UN programme's partnerships that nobody has confirmed. Adding a row
 * for either is a client decision, not a seeding one.
 *
 * Each site is the organisation's own, which is content rule 10.10 ("each
 * logo must link to its own official site") and is also the only reason the
 * pair is declared together: `partners_logo_requires_site` refuses to store a
 * logo whose partner has no link.

//   - `status`: prototype's Live|Pipeline|Reference, lowercased. The
//     prototype's R() factory defaults `status` to 'Live' — a row with no
//     explicit status in the prototype IS live, not pipeline. Applied here
//     except for the one deliberate demotion noted on `cyber4africa` below.
//   - `exclusivity`: '' -> null, 'Exclusive to AskHub' -> 'exclusive',
//     'Early access' -> 'early_access'.
//   - `geo_scope`: Global -> 'global', 'All Africa' -> 'all_africa',
//     '18 priority countries' -> 'partner_countries', 'Selected' ->
//     'specific'.
//   - `sectors_eligible`: every one of these 20 resources carries the
//     prototype's sentinel `sectors: 'All'` (none override it), which means
//     "all sectors" — transcribed as `[]`, never as `['All']` (which would
//     read as a literal, single sector named "All").
//   - `banner_image_url`: the prototype's `image` field is `''` on every one
//     of these 20 resources — transcribed as `null`.
//   - `description_fr` / `description_pt` / `description_ar`: the prototype
//     has no translated copy at all. Left `null` rather than invented —
//     locales/en.json stubs exist for fr/pt/ar, but resource copy is not a
//     UI string and has no source translation here.
//   - Dropped entirely, matching the brief: `views`, `clicks`, `match_weight`
//     (fabricated-metric columns that do not exist on `resources`),
//     `verified` (no such column — the per-resource "Verified" badge the
//     prototype renders is exactly what content rule 10.x forbids; curation
//     is stated once, globally, via site_content), `notified`, and the
//     prototype's own `id` (the real table generates its own uuid).
//   - `added_date` is transcribed from the prototype's `added` field
//     (merged with its `META` override where present) rather than left to
//     default to `current_date` — the prototype gives an explicit date for
//     every one of these 20 rows, so defaulting to today would silently
//     discard real (if placeholder) information.

// ============================================================================
// Programmes are NOT seeded. See the file header above for why: all six of
// the prototype's programme descriptions carry an unattested AI Hub
// performance figure, and programmes_public is anon-readable. `programmes`
// stays at 0 rows, same as impact_stories/headline_stats/compute_metrics,
// until the client supplies attested copy.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// Site content — the prototype's `settings.welcome` and `settings.identity`,
// flattened into (key, locale, value) rows.
// ============================================================================
//
// Key names (`welcome_title`, `welcome_body`, ...) are this seed's own
// invention — the prototype has no key/locale structure at all (it renders
// `settings.welcome.title` etc. directly) and no naming convention exists
// yet elsewhere in the codebase (checked: no other seed or source file
// establishes one). All rows are `locale: 'en'`; fr/pt/ar are stubs only
// (CLAUDE.md), not seeded here.
//
// Two content-rule rewrites applied — see task-12a-report.md for the full
// before/after of both:
//   1. `identity_align` drops the prototype's "Italy–Africa Mattei Plan"
//      clause entirely. CLAUDE.md: "'CINECA Leonardo' with no 'Mattei
//      Plan'". (The prototype's *second* Mattei Plan mention, on a
//      `partnerships` row -- "Leonardo GPU allocations under the Mattei
//      Plan" -- needs no rewrite here because `partnerships` is out of this
//      task's scope and is not seeded at all; it simply never lands.)
//   2. `welcome_body` dropped the prototype's "Curated and verified by the
//      AI Hub team." sentence. The prototype states this curation claim in
//      three different wordings across the app; content rule 10.8 wants it
//      stated once. `identity_lead` already carries the brief's canonical
//      wording verbatim ("Every resource is curated and verified by the AI
//      Hub team.") unchanged, so it is kept as the single instance and the
//      duplicate in `welcome_body` was removed rather than rephrased.
//
//      That rewrite is now history rather than a live edit: `welcome_body`
//      has since been rewritten again by an editor on the hosted project and
//      this file transcribes that value, which carries no curation claim
//      either. Rule 10.8 still holds, by the same argument and not by
//      inheritance — it was re-checked against the live string.
//
// **These rows are not the source of truth.** `site_content` is editable
// from /admin/content precisely so copy can change without a deploy, and the
// upsert below is keyed on (key, locale), so a seed run overwrites whatever
// an editor has since written. When the two disagree, the hosted value is
// the one that has been reviewed and published; update this file to match it
// rather than re-running the seed to overwrite it. Verified divergent once
// already, on 2026-08-14, for exactly this key.
